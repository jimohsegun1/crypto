## Available Scripts

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server with live-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command bundles the application into static files for optimal performance in the `.next` directory.

### Starting the Production Server

```

This will run the application on a local production server.
